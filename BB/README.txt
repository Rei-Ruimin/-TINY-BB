
1. Run 'my_game.m', it is the main function.
2. There is a main menu showing four options
    1) Start 
        We will be asked to choose our color, shape and skill (at first we only have the default ones), then the game will start.
        When we reach the boss, we can attack the boss by pressing spaece bar, and we can move by pressing ¡ü¡ý¡û¡úon key baord. There will also be a bullet (looks like '*') on the screen, it can attack us as long as it reachs us.
        We will win if hp of boss = 0 and our hp > 0, then we can earn pt (to buy new shape and skill on shop ) and the color of the boss (if we have had got the color of the boss, we will earn an extra pt); we will lost if hp of boss > 0 and our hp = 0.

     2) Shop
         We can buy new shapes and skills in shop using pt.
         Note: there is a 'random' option in shape shop; by choosing it, we can spend 2pt to draw a shape randomly. But if we draw a shape that we have had in our bag, we will still loss 2pt.

     3) Bag
         We can check our pt, colors, shapes and skills here at any time.

     4) Setting
          We can change the difficulty of the game here. The greater difficulty the boss has , the more pt we can get when we defeat it.
